## Overview

<p>EncryptionToolkit provides a set of functions for encrypting, decrypting, and generating individual view keys for records, transitions, and ciphertexts. This class enables bulk operations on records and selective decryption using record-specific view keys.</p>



## Methods

<a name="EncryptionToolkit.generateTvk"></a>

### generateTvk

<p>Generates a transition view key from the view key and the transition public key</p>

```javascript
generateTvk(view_key, tpk) ► Field
```



| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| view_key | <code>ViewKey</code> | The view key of the account that generated the transition |
| tpk | <code>Group</code> | The transition public key |
| *return* | <code>Field</code> | The transition view key |

---

<a name="EncryptionToolkit.generateRecordViewKey"></a>

### generateRecordViewKey

<p>Creates a record view key from the view key. This can later be used to decrypt a record without revealing an account's view key.</p>

```javascript
generateRecordViewKey(view_key, record_ciphertext) ► Field
```



| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| view_key | <code>ViewKey</code> | The view key of the owner of the record |
| record_ciphertext | <code>RecordCiphertext</code> | The record ciphertext used to derive the record view key |
| *return* | <code>Field</code> | The record view key |

---

<a name="EncryptionToolkit.decryptRecordWithRVk"></a>

### decryptRecordWithRVk

<p>Decrypts a record ciphertext using the record view key. Decryption only succeeds if the record view key was generated from the view key of the record owner.</p>

```javascript
decryptRecordWithRVk(record_vk, record_ciphertext) ► RecordPlaintext
```



| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| record_vk | <code>Field</code> | The record view key |
| record_ciphertext | <code>RecordCiphertext</code> | The record ciphertext to decrypt |
| *return* | <code>RecordPlaintext</code> | The decrypted record plaintext |

---

<a name="EncryptionToolkit.decryptTransitionWithVk"></a>

### decryptTransitionWithVk

<p>Decrypts a transition using the transition view key. The ciphertext inputs and outputs can only be decrypted if the transition view key was generated by the transaction signer.</p>

```javascript
decryptTransitionWithVk(transition, transition_vk) ► Transition
```



| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| transition | <code>Transition</code> | The transition to decrypt |
| transition_vk | <code>Field</code> | The transition view key |
| *return* | <code>Transition</code> | The decrypted transition |

---

<a name="EncryptionToolkit.decryptOwnedRecords"></a>

### decryptOwnedRecords

<p>Decrypts a set of record ciphertexts in parallel and stores successful decryptions</p>

```javascript
decryptOwnedRecords(view_key, records) ► Array<RecordPlaintext>
```



| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| view_key | <code>ViewKey</code> | The view key of the owner of the records |
| records | <code>Array&lt;RecordCiphertext&gt;</code> | The record ciphertexts to decrypt |
| *return* | <code>Array&lt;RecordPlaintext&gt;</code> | The decrypted record plaintexts |

---

<a name="EncryptionToolkit.checkOwnedRecords"></a>

### checkOwnedRecords

<p>Checks if record ciphertexts are owned by the given view key</p>

```javascript
checkOwnedRecords(view_key, records) ► Array<RecordCiphertext>
```



| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| view_key | <code>ViewKey</code> | View key of the owner of the records |
| records | <code>Array&lt;RecordCiphertext&gt;</code> | The record ciphertexts for which to check ownership |
| *return* | <code>Array&lt;RecordCiphertext&gt;</code> | The record ciphertexts that are owned by the view key |

---

<a name="EncryptionToolkit.decryptSender"></a>

### decryptSender

<p>Decrypt the sender ciphertext associated with a record</p>

```javascript
decryptSender(view_key, record, sender_ciphertext) ► Address
```



| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| view_key | <code>ViewKey</code> | View key associated with the record |
| record | <code>RecordPlaintext</code> | Record plaintext associated with a sender |
| sender_ciphertext | <code>Field</code> | Sender ciphertext associated with the record |
| *return* | <code>Address</code> | Address of the sender |

---

<a name="EncryptionToolkit.decryptSenderWithRvk"></a>

### decryptSenderWithRvk

<p>Decrypt the sender ciphertext associated with the record using the record view key</p>

```javascript
decryptSenderWithRvk(record_view_key, sender_ciphertext) ► Address
```



| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| record_view_key | <code>Field</code> | Record view key associated with the record |
| sender_ciphertext | <code>Field</code> | Sender ciphertext associated with the record |
| *return* | <code>Address</code> | The address of the sender |
