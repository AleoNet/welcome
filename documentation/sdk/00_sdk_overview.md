The [Provable SDK](https://github.com/provablehq/sdk) provides tools for building zero knowledge applications. It consists of
several TypeScript & JavaScript libraries which provide the following functionality:
1. [Aleo account management](https://provable.tools/account)
2. [Web-based program execution and deployment](https://provable.tools/develop)
3. [Aleo credit transfers](https://provable.tools/transfer)
4. [Management of program state and data](https://provable.tools/record)
5. [Communication with the Aleo network](https://provable.tools/rest)

All of this functionality is demonstrated on [provable.tools](https://www.provable.tools/).

The Provable SDK is divided into three Typescript/Javascript packages

## 1. [Provable SDK](./typescript/00_sdk_overview.md) - Build Zero Knowledge Web Apps

The official Provable SDK providing Javascript/Typescript tools for creating zero knowledge apps.

### âš¡ Build your own app

Start here with the [documentation](./typescript/00_sdk_overview.md) and follow the instructions to install the [Provable SDK](https://github.com/provablehq/sdk/tree/testnet3/sdk#readme) to get started building your
first zero knowledge web app.

## 2. [Create-Leo-App](./create-leo-app/00_app_installation.md) - Zero Knowledge Web App Examples

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-leo-app"> <img alt="Create Leo App" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/l/create-leo-app?label=NPM%20-%20Create-Leo-App&labelColor=green&color=blue" /></a>

Create-leo-app provides zero-knowledge web app examples in common web frameworks such as React. Developers looking to
start with working examples should start here.

### âš¡ Build your own app


You can start with a template by running
```bash
npm create leo-app@latest
```

## 3. [Aleo-Wasm](./wasm/01_address.md) - Zero Knowledge Algorithms in JavaScript + WebAssembly

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@provablehq/wasm"> <img alt="Create Leo App" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/l/%40provablehq%2Fwasm?label=NPM%20-%20Aleo%20Wasm&labelColor=green&color=blue" /></a>
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/aleo-wasm"> <img alt="Aleo-Wasm" src="https://img.shields.io/crates/v/aleo-wasm.svg?color=neon" /></a>

Aleo Wasm is a Rust crate which compiles Aleo code responsible for creating and executing zero knowledge programs into
WebAssembly.

When compiled with `wasm-pack` JavaScript bindings are generated for the WebAssembly allowing Aleo zero
knowledge programs to be used in the browser and NodeJS. This package is available on NPM (linked above).

## ðŸ“š Documentation

#### [API Documentation](../apis/v2/provable-api.info.mdx)
This API documentation provides information on the available endpoints to query the Aleo network.


#### [SDK Readme](https://github.com/ProvableHQ/sdk/tree/mainnet/sdk#readme)
The SDK Readme provides concepts core to executing zero knowledge programs in the web and several detailed examples of
how to use the SDK to build web apps using Aleo.

#### [Aleo Wasm Readme](https://github.com/ProvableHQ/sdk/tree/mainnet/wasm#readme)
The Aleo Wasm Readme provides instructions for compiling the Aleo Wasm crate and using it in web projects. Those who
want to build from source or create their own WebAssembly bindings should start here
