### 1.2 Install Rust

**[bit.ly/start-rust](https://bit.ly/start-rust)**

### 1.3 Install Leo

Installing Leo by building from the source code as follows:
```bash
# Download the source code and initialize the submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ProvableHQ/leo

```bash
leo --version
```

You can update Leo to the latest version using the following command:
```bash
leo update
```

### 1.6 Optional: IDE Syntax Highlighting

Aleo maintains syntax highlighting implementations for various popular code editors. This can significantly enhance your development experience by providing visual cues and making your Leo code more readable. Here's a brief overview of the supported editors:

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Sublime Text
3. Intellij

For detailed instructions on how to set up syntax highlighting for these editors, please refer to the [Tooling for Leo](https://docs.leo-lang.org/getting_started/ide#plugins) guide.

## 2. Installing snarkOS

### 2.1 Prerequisites

Before beginning, please ensure your machine has Rust v1.79+ installed. Instructions to install Rust can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### 2.2 Clone the snarkOS repository

```bash
git clone --branch mainnet --single-branch https://github.com/AleoNet/snarkOS.git
```

**[For Ubuntu users]** A helper script to install dependencies is available. From the snarkOS directory, run:
```bash
./build_ubuntu.sh
```

### 2.3 Install snarkOS

```bash
cd snarkOS
cargo install --locked --path .
```

### 2.4 Verify Installation

## 3. Next Steps

Once you have successfully completed the installation of both Leo and snarkOS, you are ready to begin your journey with Aleo.

To get started quickly and see Aleo in action, we recommend proceeding to the [Quick Start Guide](01_quick_start). This guide will walk you through creating your first Aleo application, deploying it to the network, and executing it. This hands-on experience will give you a practical understanding of the Aleo platform's core features and workflow.

For local development, use the following [guide](link to Leo docs here) for how to deploy programs to a local network.
