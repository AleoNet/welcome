Welcome to the Aleo Quickstart. This quickstart will guide you through the core concepts of building on Aleo. In this guide, you will be guided through the process of deploying and interacting with your own Aleo program directly on the web via the [Leo Playground](https://play.leo-lang.org). 

## What you'll learn
1. **Aleo Accounts:** Learn how to create an Aleo account and create private and public data.
2. **Aleo Programs:** Learn how to interact with the Aleo network by deploying and executing your own program.
3. **Private and Public State:** Learn how to manage both private and public data on Aleo in order to create privacy preseving apps.

## 1.  The Token program

Aleo's unique architecture enables a wide range of programs and applications beyond tokens and DeFi.  We use the Token program in this guide to illustrate how developers manage private and public state with an intuitive example.

Navigate to the [Leo Playground](https://play.leo-lang.org) and select `Token` from the `Examples` dropdown menu.

:::info
The Token program simulates a token markeplace and enables a user to mint and transfer private and public tokens.  It is used to showcase how developers manage private and public state on the Aleo Network. Private tokens in this program are represented in encrypted data structures called Records and public tokens are recorded in public on-chain datastores called mappings.

## 2. Generate a new Aleo account

### 2.1 Using the Leo Playground widget

* Click on the Account Widget to generate a new Aleo Account.

<img src={require('./images/new_account.png').default} width="400"/>

:::note
Save your **Address**, **View Key**, and **Private Key** in a safe place, you'll need them later.
:::

### 2.2 Using the Ecosystem Wallets

* [Puzzle Wallet](https://puzzle.online/wallet)
* [Leo Wallet](https://www.leo.app/)
* [Soter Wallet](https://sotertech.io/)

## 3. Seeding your wallet with credits

To seed your wallet, you'll need to request credits from the faucet provided by the ecosystem wallets at:
* [Puzzle Wallet Faucet](https://dev.puzzle.online/faucet)
* [Leo Wallet Discord](https://www.leo.app/) (Scroll to bottom of the landing page to find Discord invite)

The credits received from the faucet will be public credits, which means they are publicly visible on the Aleo network.

You can check your account balance by selecting the `Get Account Balance` from the list of options in the query widget.

<img src={require('./images/account_balance.png').default} width="400"/>

Clicking the `Open` button will link to your account balance on the [Provable Explorer](https://testnet.explorer.provable.com/) page.

<img src={require('./images/provable_explorer.png').default} width="400"/>

Here is a list of ecosystem explorers:
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
- [Provable Explorer](https://testnet.explorer.provable.com/)
- [Aleoscan](https://testnet.aleoscan.io/)
- [Aleo123](https://testnet.aleo123.io/)
- [Aleo.Info](https://testnet.aleo.info/)
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

:::tip
While waiting for the credits to be sent to your wallet, you can proceed to the next step.
:::

## 3. Deploy a token program from the Leo Playground

Change the name of the program in line 1 of `src/main.leo` to use a unique identifier and then update the `program` field in the `program.json` file to match the new name. 

<img src={require('./images/program_name_.png').default} width="800"/>

<img src={require('./images/program_json_.png').default} width="800"/>

:::tip
The length of the application name should be at least 10 characters. Deployment costs are higher for names shorter than 10 characters.
:::

You are now ready to deploy your first Aleo program to the Testnet!

## 4. Deploy your token application

:::tip Make sure that your account is funded with sufficient Testnet credits to deploy to the network.  
:::

* Deploy your Leo application to Aleo Testnet

Click on the deploy widget to bring up the deployment window.

<img src={require('./images/deploy.png').default} width="400"/>

Enter your program name in the `Program ID` field and then enter your Private Key.

You can view an estimate for the deployment cost by clicking `Estimate Fee`.  When you are ready to deploy, click `Deploy`.

You should have seen a confirmation that your Aleo application was deployed in the form of a pop-up with a transaction ID. 

<img src={require('./images/deployment.png').default} width="800"/>

Copy your transaction ID to view the details of your deployment transaction on the Aleo block explorers:

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
- [Provable Explorer](https://testnet.explorer.provable.com/)
- [Aleoscan](https://testnet.aleoscan.io/)
- [Aleo123](https://testnet.aleo123.io/)
- [Aleo.Info](https://testnet.aleo.info/)
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

:::info
Depending on the size of your program, you may not have sufficient credits to deploy your program if you are using an account funded with only one faucet transaction.  If that's the case, you can still interact with a program already deployed to the Testnet.
:::

## 5. Execute a transaction

You can now use your deployed token program!  

:::tip
If you did not have enough funds to deploy a program, you can use the [`token_quickstart.aleo`](https://play.leo-lang.org/?gistId=b6730338a24169308348d5e38243665d&revision=3339199a4ac60976dc5ce6c0c35c5eefb0488ee0) program to test the execution of the token program methods.
:::

When you call one of your program's functions, the logic is executed locally and a zero-knowledge proof is built. This proof attests to the correctness of the program execution and its corresponding outputs while keeping hidden inputs or outputs encrypted. After a function is executed, an Execution Transaction is submitted to the Aleo Network that contains a summary of the execution and a proof of its correctness. This transaction will be accepted when a network validator validates the proof and that the proper fee was paid. 

* Minting a private token

Below we will mint a private token using the `mint_private` function. This function will create an Aleo `Record` which represents the new token.  Records are encrypted data structures stored on-chain as ciphertexts that can only be decrypted by the owner of the record (using the owner's View key). This ensures that only the owner of the record knows its content, thus keeping the token private.

To mint a private token, navigate to the Execute widget in the Leo Playground and enter the name of your program in the Program ID tab.  Alternatively, you can use the deployed token program 'token_quickstart.aleo`.  

:::tip
Click the magnifying glass icon to confirm that the Program ID corresponds to a deployed program.
:::

<img src={require('./images/execute.png').default} width="400"/>

Next, enter your Private Key and select the `mint_private` method from the Function drop-down menu.  In the Inputs tab, enter your Account Address and a `u64` integer.

```
["ALEO_ADDRESS_HERE", "50u64"]
```
Click Estimate Fee followed by Execute.  As before with the deploy transaction, you can copy and past your transaction ID in a block explorer.  You should see something resembling the following:

<img src={require('./images/mint_private.png').default} width="1000"/>

:::info
The output of the transaction is a Record.  In order to decrypt the Record, you need to copy and past the ciphertext, navigate to the Records widget in the Leo Playground, enter the Record ciphertext along with the View Key that corresponds to your Account's Private Key, and click Decrypt.  The decrypted Record should resemble the following:
```
{
  owner: aleo1kypwp5m7qtk9mwazgcpg0tq8aal23mnrvwfvug65qgcg9xvsrqgspyjm6n.private,
  amount: 50u64.private,
  _nonce: 3175255370513411091535466147458245312227668453916963245036391157478647265587group.public
}
```

:::

* Mint a public token

In the Token program, public balances are stored in program mappings. Mappings are public key-value stores on Aleo Network nodes which store long term persistent public state onchain.

Below we will mint a public token using the `mint_public` function. When this function is run, it will update the balance in the `account` mapping corresponding to the specified Aleo `address`. 

Navigate back to the Execute widget and repeat the steps in the previous section for minting a public token.  The transaction summary from the block explorer should resemble the following:

<img src={require('./images/mint_public.png').default} width="1000"/>

Unlike the `mint_private` function, the `mint_public` function creates an execution transaction that contains a `Future` instead of a `Record`.  A `Future`  contains a set of instructions for validators to execute on-chain which can read or update mappings.  If the `mint_public` execution transaction is valid, it will be accepted by the validators which will run the instructions in the `mint_public` `Future` that update the `account` mapping.

This account mapping can then be queried publicly by anyone.
