3. Choose the appropriate issue template if available, or start with a blank issue.
4. Provide a clear and concise title that summarizes the issue or suggestion.
5. In the description:
   - For bugs or errors: Describe what you expected to see and what you actually saw. Include steps to reproduce if applicable.
   - For improvement suggestions: Explain your idea and how it would enhance the documentation.
   - If relevant, include screenshots or code snippets to illustrate your point.
6. Add appropriate labels to your issue (e.g., "documentation", "enhancement", "bug").
7. Submit the issue.

Your feedback helps us identify areas for improvement and ensures the documentation remains accurate and helpful for all users.
