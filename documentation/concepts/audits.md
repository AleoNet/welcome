## Overview

The snarkVM stack (including AleoVM components) and the broader Aleo stack have undergone third-party security reviews and audits. This page links to official announcements and public audit reports. Blog posts are typically **high-level summaries**, the audit reports are the canonical source of findings, severity, and remediation status.
