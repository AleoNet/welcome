The Provable API is designed to provide users with access to the Aleo blockchain through RESTful endpoints that allow one to query the network for block level information, transactions, transitions, and more. Developers can easily interact directly with Aleo through both retrieving data as well as broadcasting transactions.

## API Base URLs

The base URL for all endpoints is:

```
https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1
```

The `{network}` parameter (such as `mainnet` or `testnet`) should be included in the path of each endpoint to specify the network.

The table below provides example URLs for different environments:

| Environment | Example URL                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Mainnet     | https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/mainnet |
| Testnet     | https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/testnet  |

## Rate Limiting

Users are allowed to perform **5 requests per second** and up to **100,000 requests per day**.

Rate limiting will be enforced and users are subject to blacklisting if they abuse the use of our API. For inquiries into obtaining higher rate limits, please reach out at devservices@provable.com.
