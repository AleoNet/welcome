:::warning
Version 1 API is outdated and will be deprecated soon. Please migrate to v2 for more endpoints and improved response codes.
:::
The Provable API is designed to provide users with access to the Aleo blockchain through RESTful endpoints that allow one to query the network for block level information, transactions, transitions, and more. Developers can easily interact directly with Aleo through both retrieving data as well as broadcasting transactions.
